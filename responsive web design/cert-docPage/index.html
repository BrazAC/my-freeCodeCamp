            <p>Flexbox, short for Flexible Box, is a powerful layout model in CSS that revolutionized 
                the way developers create responsive and dynamic web layouts. Its primary goal is to 
                offer a more efficient and predictable way to distribute available space among elements 
                within a container, regardless of their size or the container's dimensions. Flexbox 
                operates on two main components: the flex container and its child items.</p>
            <p>By applying <code>display: flex</code> or <code>display: inline-flex</code> to an element, it becomes a flex 
                container, and its immediate children become flex items. This paradigm shift in layout 
                design introduces a more intuitive approach to handling both alignment and distribution 
                of space among these items.</p>

            <header>Flex Container and Items</header>
            <p>The flex container establishes a flex formatting context, which dictates how its child 
                elements are displayed and behaves according to Flexbox rules. Meanwhile, flex items 
                are the individual components within the container that can be flexibly arranged, 
                reordered, aligned, and sized.</p>
            <p>The power of Flexbox lies in its ability to control layout direction, stacking, and 
                alignment without having to resort to traditional CSS approaches, such as floats or 
                positioning. This model empowers developers to create dynamic, responsive, and adaptive 
                designs efficiently.</p>

            <header>Flex Container Properties</header>
            <p>Flexbox provides several properties that dictate the layout and alignment of items within the flex container.</p>
            <p>Bla bla bla insert text</p>
            <ul>
                <li>justify-content and align-items: The <code>justify-content</code> property controls the distribution of space between 
                    flex items along the main axis of the flex container, allowing for precise alignment. Meanwhile, <code>align-items</code> 
                    aligns the items along the cross axis, ensuring consistent alignment vertically.</li>
                <li>flex-direction and flex-wrap: The <code>flex-direction</code> property defines the primary axis of the flex container, enabling 
                    layout control in rows or columns. Additionally, <code>flex-wrap</code> permits items to wrap onto multiple lines or prevent wrapping, 
                    influencing how items flow within the container.</li>
            </ul>
            
        </section>
        <section id="Flex_Item_Properties_and_Alignment" class="main-section">
            <header>Flex Item Properties and Alignment</header>
            <p>Flex items possess properties that define their behavior within the flex container.</p>
            <p>Bla bla bla insert text</p>
            <ul>
                <li>flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis: These properties determine how flex items grow, shrink, 
                    and establish their initial size within the flex container. <code></code>flex-grow allows items to expand proportionally, 
                    <code></code>flex-shrink controls their ability to shrink, and <code></code>flex-basis sets the initial size.
                </li>
                <li>align-self and order: <code>align-self</code> offers individual flex item alignment overrides, allowing specific items to 
                    deviate from the container's alignment settings. order permits rearranging items within the container's display 
                    order, enabling the manipulation of the visual order without changing the underlying HTML structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <p> Flexbox is a game-changer in responsive web design. Its fluid nature allows elements to dynamically adjust their layout and 
                size based on the available space, making it a valuable tool in crafting adaptable and responsive interfaces.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flexibility and Adaptability: One of Flexbox's main strengths is its adaptability to various screen sizes and devices. 
                    Its ability to create layouts that fluidly respond to changes in screen dimensions significantly simplifies development, 
                    resulting in a consistent and engaging user experience across different devices and viewports.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This comprehensive breakdown explores the core principles of Flexbox, encompassing its structure, container and item properties, 
                responsive design capabilities, and its pivotal role in crafting dynamic and adaptive layouts within web development</p>
